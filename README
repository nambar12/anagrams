# Anagrams Matcher
Your task is to create a program which finds anagrams within a given input.

## Anagram definition
Two strings are considered anagrams. if they have the same letters with different permutations. For example: "abbcdef" abd "fedcbab" are anagrams. They should be of the same length and each letter should show up identical number of times in each of the strings.

## Challenge
The challenge is to write a program which gets as an input a series of strings and output the number of anagrams within this series. The input is not sorted and strings can be of any size. The program's runtime should be as short as possible. The programs should read the input strings from its standard input and output the number or anagrams to its standard output.

### Examples
for the following input:

    abc
    abcd
    abdc
    acb
the program output should be:

    2

for the following input:

    abc
    acb
    bac
the program output should be:

    1
## Checking the program
The checker.py script tests the programs with several sets of input data and prints out the result
